    // Hi! Check this out! It's an important button to press...
    // Zeroes out the gyro
    // Yup. You want to press that when the robot is facing North to ensure alignment.
    // Also, when setting up the robot (if you don't have an auto for swerve)
    // you have to set it parallel to driver station lol yea
    // and facing the right direction. Everything field oriented would then be based on that.

    // ORRR if you forget or something, just have a driver align it against a wall or visually, and then have them hit this Zero button. Should reset the gyro.

    // is makes sense, yes?
    // âœ…
    // Now. This does affect the BEHAVIOR of the modules.
    // By resetting the gyro, you're also telling the odometry, "Hey, THIS is actually north! Please remember that"
    // Which means your modules are going to behave accordingly. yeah?


    // ahh, lol. kind of, yes!

    // They should ONLY really matter when setting your offsets. the way we were doing it at Waco is that the bevel gears all face one cardinal-ish direction

    // so, like, they all face to the RIGHT of the robot. This means two would face the inside, and the others face the outside
    // YES
    // the paint is good

    // Yup. once the offsets are configured, you can turn the modules however you want in a match, and be totally fine through a power cycle.
    // HOWEVER
    // You'd have to reset offsets IF you meddle with a module (in terms of REMOVING it.) So, say you need to swap or repair a module,
    // then you have to redo its offsets 
    // massively time consuming to set offsets. yup. Technically it's like a 5-10 minute job, but do you really have that in a pit? Nope.
    
    // Ooooh hmmmm hm hm hm
    // is that how this code does it? I don't think any code base I know of allows that, lol
   
   
    //!!
    // resettting module angle offsets is different from GYRO reset.
    // nerp
    // The gyro can only handle "all of the wheels relative to where you want North to be"
    // Module offsets are on a per module basis. Those regard the CANCoder!
    // True!


// we gotta clean up these comments LMAO and leave notes in here?

// Fair. Although, I will say - if you ever come BACK to this, you'll want some *relevant* notes here. <<<<<<<<<

// Okay thrifty bot huehuehue
// amarillo...
// yippee! Ask around if you can acquire some from another team, idk about their shipping
// not really... sort of? lol
// now... I could go on a MASSIVE explanation
// Simple details:
// The CANCoders function very well with Falcons. Falcons can directly read data from a CANCoder on the same network. Yes, CTRE. >:(
// Sooo. Technically, of course you can *use* CANCoders and NEOs. People are doing it all over the place.
// TTB encoder is a more "old school analog encoder". And! It can plug in directly to the Rio in an analog in port
// OR!
// Directly to a smax.
// Meaning, you get the same benefit of keeping any PID business on the motor controller if you plug it in to the smax;;;
  // You do need an adapter board though
// https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-11-1881/

// COOL MONEY POINT!
// Sell the cancoders for a profit LMFAO
// hj^ like literally, people need them BAD
// so you genuinely could sell them for a profit IF that's okay with coaches
// ask Brian (ladycans mentor) before buying those, idk if it's actually worth it to use ttb over cancoder for sure. on paper it should be...
// but ofc... just ttb enc to rio otherwise! that totally works :) (kind of a lot of wires but ehhh lol)
